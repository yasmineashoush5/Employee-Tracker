# Employee-Tracker
I built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
I added some additional functionality to my application, such as the ability to do the following:

Update employee managers.

View employees by manager.

View employees by department.

Delete departments, roles, and employees.

View the total utilized budget of a departmentâ€”in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
